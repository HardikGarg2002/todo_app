* In here i used two ways to show multiple elements

    Multiple cards in app &
    Multiple tasks in card

    1. Multiple cards in app--> 
    writting map function in parent directly --> map is iterated over list of cards maintained

    2. Multiple tasks in card-->
    writting map function in child --> by sending list of tasks to the child and map function is handled in the child only.

* After addition i want to change the input area to be changed to default
    In the element {input} just have the {value} attribute to newTask -->which is emptied("") on every submission(addition).
